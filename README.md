# Learning Rust

This is my journey learning rust, and the projects that I have made along this journey

To Build Use:

        cargo run

in the directory that you want to compile.

# Details of Each
## Login Details
<details><summary>0001</summary>

[easy] challenge #1

create a program that will ask the users name, age,
and reddit username.
have it tell them the information back, in the format:

## FMA Phisics Calculator
<details><summary>0002</summary>
[easy] challenge #2

Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your programs,
so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application that has use in your life.
It might be an interest calculator, or it might be
something that you can use in the classroom.
For example, if you were in physics class, you might want to make a F = M * A calc.

EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions!
Not only should it be able to calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!

<details><summary>0005</summary>

## Number Line Print
<details><summary>0006</summary>
This is a challenge I have formulated while my child was
learning his number lines.

I enscribed a quick note in my journel and seemed possible.

So the challenge is to get points up to four and be able to
graph them on a number line.

BONUS if you can do negatives

Extra BONUS if you can get variables through another
like >3, witch prints all that is greater, upto 10;
</details>

## Line Renderer
<details><summary>0007</summary>
Make a 2d line renderer, with the
user inputting two points and make a line in-between them

BONUS if you can do multiple lines,
with different colors for each.

EXTRA BONUS If you can make it scale procedurally, for
example normally if you had a number line it would look line

But that could not scale up reliably if, for example one of
your points was at 100, 100, it would fill the entire screen
and wrap.
</details>


## Pet Managment
<details><summary>0008</summary>
Make a simple application for managing your pets, using some
sort of local file for storage, like a json file.


BONUS: If you can make it a tui,

EXTRA BONUS: If you make it look good :)
